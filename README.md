# Overview

In todayâ€™s rapidly evolving technology landscape, serverless architecture has gained immense popularity due to its scalability, cost-effectiveness, and ease of deployment. AWS (Amazon Web Services) provides a robust serverless platform, offering services like AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB, which allow you to deploy and run your Node.js applications without the need to manage the underlying infrastructure.

## Introduction

In this blog post, we will learn about AWS Serverless, AWS Lambda, and how to build NodeJS APIs using AWS Lambda and NodeJS.

## AWS Serverless:

AWS Serverless is a cloud computing model where the provider manages the underlying infrastructure and automatically provisions and scales resources based on demand without requiring the user to manage servers or infrastructure.

## AWS Lambda

AWS Lambda is a computing service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You upload your code, and Lambda runs it, scaling automatically to handle requests. It supports multiple programming languages, including Node.js, and is commonly used for building serverless applications. With AWS Lambda, you only pay for the compute time you consume, making it a cost-effective solution for running applications with variable workloads.
